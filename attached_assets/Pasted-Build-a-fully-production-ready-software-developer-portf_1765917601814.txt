Build a fully production-ready software developer portfolio website using Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, Tailwind CSS v4, and GSAP.
The project must be frontend-only (no backend required initially) and structured for scalability, performance, accessibility, and clean maintainability.

1. Core Objective

Create a premium Apple-inspired portfolio for a software developer named Siva.
The website should feel minimal, cinematic, fluid, and high-end, similar to apple.com, Linear, or Stripe, and suitable for a senior-level software engineer.

2. Design & Visual Style
Overall Look

Dark-mode-first design.

Apple iOS / apple.com-inspired glassmorphism UI.

Clean, quiet, confident design — no clutter, no flashy effects.

Glassmorphism Rules

Frosted glass containers using:

bg-white/10

backdrop-blur-xl

subtle borders (border-white/10–15)

Soft depth and shadows.

Large rounded corners (pill and card-style).

Color System

Base: deep blacks and dark greys.

Text: off-white with hierarchy via opacity.

Accent: very subtle yellow / violet / blue tint only for CTAs.

No neon colors, no heavy gradients.

Typography

Clean modern sans-serif (Apple-like).

Large headings with generous spacing.

Calm reading rhythm.

3. Navbar (Must Match Reference Style)

Floating pill-shaped navbar centered at the top.

Glass background with blur.

Rounded-full container.

Left: logo or icon.

Center: navigation links.

Right: highlighted CTA button.

Required Animations

Scroll-triggered reveal animations for sections.

Staggered entrance animations for cards.

Subtle parallax depth where appropriate.

Magnetic hover effect on buttons and interactive cards.

Motion Rules

Performance-first.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Animations must enhance storytelling, not distract.

5. Custom Cursor

Replace default cursor with a custom Apple-style cursor.

Minimal circular design.

Smooth trailing motion.

Subtle scale or opacity change on hover and click.

Cursor must:

Be disabled for reduced-motion users.

Not interfere with text selection or inputs.
